Great choice 🎉 Canva is very good for clean and professional academic/technical videos. Since you’ll combine presentation slides (from Canva) + your MATLAB demo, here’s a step-by-step workflow to make the best video:

🎬 Workflow for Your Bidirectional DC-DC Converter Video with Canva
1. Plan Your Flow

Follow the slide structure I gave you earlier (Title → Motivation → Principle → Circuit → Control → MATLAB Demo → Applications → Conclusion).

Keep each slide short (max 4–5 bullet points) and use visuals/diagrams instead of heavy text.

2. Design Slides in Canva

Choose a clean academic template (white background, blue/green/gray accents).

Use icons/illustrations from Canva library (battery, EV, solar panel, arrows).

For formulas (like buck/boost equations), use LaTeX rendered images (Canva doesn’t support LaTeX directly, but you can generate the formula as an image and upload).

Keep font consistent (e.g., Montserrat or Open Sans).

Use slide animations like fade in or pop for arrows and diagrams.

3. Narration / Voice-over

Decide: Do you want to record yourself speaking or just add background text + music?

Best option: Record narration (even with your laptop mic, but in a quiet room).

In Canva → Upload → Record yourself while showing slides (or upload pre-recorded audio).

4. Adding MATLAB Demo

Record your MATLAB/Simulink simulation with OBS Studio or built-in screen recorder.

Show:

Buck mode waveform (charging).

Boost mode waveform (regenerative braking).

Keep each demo short (20–30 sec).

Export these clips and upload them into Canva.

Insert them after your “MATLAB/Simulink Demo” slide.

5. Video Assembly

In Canva:

Put slides in correct order.

Add short transitions (slide → fade) between sections.

Place narration or text captions under each slide.

Insert your MATLAB clips in the right place.

6. Background & Style

Add soft background music (Canva has free options).

Keep volume low so your narration is clear.

Use consistent color palette:

Blue (technology) + Green (energy) + White (clean).

Add animated arrows to show power flow directions in buck/boost slides.

7. Exporting & Upload

Export in 1080p (Full HD), MP4 format.

Length: 6–10 minutes is ideal for technical YouTube videos.

Add YouTube title & thumbnail in Canva (e.g., “⚡ Bidirectional DC-DC Converter Explained | EV & Renewable Energy Applications”).

✅ End result: A professional lecture-style explainer video + live MATLAB demo, easy for both students and engineers to understand.
